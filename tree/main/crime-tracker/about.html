            <div class="cell medium-4">
              <h4>Vue.js</h4>
              <p>
                Vue.js is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end
                JavaScript library for building user interfaces and single page
                applications. We used Vue to communicate with our RESTful server
                which handles the crime database, as well as building the
                website in a single page.
              </p>

            <div class="cell medium-4">
              <h4>Leaflet</h4>
              <p>
                Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library used to build
                interactive maps. We used it to display the neighborhood bounds,
                and a map that could update to show addresses and coordinates.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="cell medium-4">
              <h4>Nominatim</h4>
              <p>
                Nominatim is a search engine for geographical data, specifically
                designed for searching and retrieving information about
                locations on the Earth's surface. We used it here to be able to
                convert latitide and longitude coordinates into street addresses
                to be displayed on the Leaflet map.

          <h4>Our St. Paul Crime API</h4>
          <p>
            This API, built using Node.js and Express, serves as a backend for
            our St. Paul Crime Data project. It connects to a SQLite3 database
            containing Saint Paul's crime incident data, including crime codes,
            neighborhoods, and incidents. The API provides various endpoints to
            retrieve data, such as crime codes, neighborhood details, and
            specific crime incidents. Additionally, it supports filtering data
            based on parameters like start and end dates, crime codes, police
            grid, and neighborhood numbers. The API also includes
            functionalities for adding new crime incidents via a PUT request,
            used in the Add New Incident form and removing existing incidents
            via a DELETE request, used for the table's delete buttons.
