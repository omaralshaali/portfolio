For this assignment, I developed a Gradebook program using COBOL. This task involved handling a structured data file and implementing logic to read and process student records. By writing and testing the gradebook program, I gained practical experience in file handling, data manipulation, and output formatting in COBOL. This was particularly rewarding as it demonstrated the practical applications of COBOL in processing and managing data files, a common use case in legacy systems.

The final and most challenging part of the assignment was the transactions program. Here, I had to incorporate input validation and error handling into the program, significantly increasing its complexity and functionality. The program read records from a transactions file, validated each field according to specified criteria, and calculated totals for transactions, items purchased, and total cost. If a record failed validation, it displayed a rejection message. This part of the assignment taught me how to implement robust data validation and error handling, ensuring that only valid data was processed and output.

Throughout the assignment, I developed a comprehensive understanding of COBOL's capabilities and its use in data processing tasks. Each stage built upon the previous one, enhancing my skills incrementally and culminating in a functional and efficient transaction processing program. This assignment has been instrumental in deepening my knowledge of COBOL and its practical applications in business and data processing contexts.
